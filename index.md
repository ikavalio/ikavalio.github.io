## Ivan Kavaliou

Hi, I'm a software engineer and engineering leader with experience in site reliability, system, software,
and performance engineering. I'm based in Ireland, but I was born in [Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus). I hold an MSc and BSc degrees 
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from Belarus State University and I started my career in late 2011.

My native languages are Belarusian and Russian, but I speak English fluently and studied Spanish.
