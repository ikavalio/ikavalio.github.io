## Ivan Kavaliou

Hi, I'm a performance engineer with 5+ years of experience. I live in Ireland, but I was born in [Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus) in early 90s. I hold a masters degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from Belarus State University and I started my career in late 2011. 

My native languages are Belarusian and Russian, but I speak English fluently and studied Spanish.

__Education:__

2009-2015, MSc in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.

[Belarus State University / Belaruski Dziarzhauny Universitet](https://bsu.by/).

I studied data analysis and machine learning in bioinformatics (bacterial GWAS). We wrote a couple of papers on the subject, see a full list of them on a separate page.

__Certificates:__

I often take courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), see a full list of courses I completed and certificates on a separate page.

- Evaluating performance and scalability of all custom and 3rd party microservices/applications used within Workday.
- Reproducing and investigating complex production issues.
- Profiling and benchmarking different layers of Workday stack: hardware, network, persistence, web tier, etc.
- Developing and maintaining performance lab automation, bechmarks harness, various tools for performance testing and analysis.
- Predicting systems' and applications' performance and utilization for large customer events, capacity planning.
- Applications tuning and opimization.

_2011-2016: Lead Performance Engineer/Analyst, Performance Optimization Group, [EPAM Systems](https://www.epam.com/)._
- Performance testing and optimization planning, presales activities.
- Performance audit: hardware specs, software stacks and configuration, scalability estimations.
- Test driven performance optimization: tests development, test infrastructure and automation setup (automated performance testing environments), test execution, results analysis, etc.
- Finding complex application/infrastructure bottlenecks: application profiling, monitoring, etc.
- Servers’ administration: Linux/Windows server’s configuration and tuning, DB administration.
- Custom tools and applications development for data processing, visualization and analysis.

__Other Experience:__

I contribute to open source projects occasionally. I did a couple of things for
- [honest-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/honest-profiler), C++11/Java
- [cytoscape.js](https://github.com/ikavalio/cytoscape.js), JavaScript
- [MDRTB-pipe](https://github.com/ikavalio/MDRTB-pipe), part of my MSc project, R

I also helped to make an introductiory course in bioinformatics and was a lecturer on statistical methods lesson. 

__Technologies:__

- Feel comfortable working with _JVM_ as a runtime, _Java_, _C/C++_, _R_, _javascript_, _python_ and _bash_. I did some _golang_ and _ruby_ for fun.
- Have experience in _HPE LoadRunner_, _JMeter_ (including custom plugins development), _Gatling_, _tsung_, _Yandex Tank_ and other tools/frameworks that can be used as a load generators or benchmark harness.
- Had a chance to use lots of tools for JVM and native applications monitoring and profiling: _jstack_, _jstat_, _jmap_, _VisualVM_, _JProfiler_, _honest-profiler_, _async-profiler_, _perf_, _gdb_, _Dynatrace & Yourkit java profilers_, etc.
- Work a lot with Linux and configuration management tools, mostly with _Puppet_ and _Ansible_. I use _docker_ and have some knowledge of _Kubernetes_.
- Worked with different databases on bare metal and cloud: _MySQL_, _PostgreSQL_, _MongoDB_, _Oracle_, _Riak_, _AWS Aurora_.
- Have experience in various frameworks and algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning. 

__Hobbies:__

Very generic
